<pre>
What happens to a dream [ internalized ] -
engrained so deeply that one can see the crucial ideals
    clinging \\ desperately
to each uttered word like dew at the tip of a leaf
        so intertwined with one's being
        that to lose
            the dream
        would be to lose
            oneself

Does every action inspired by that dream leave
    [ traces ] of ideology
in the footprint of time

A
    tangible
    reconcilable
    historic
                [ Proof ]

Does every action carry a weight
A tentacle
Pulling
    from the bottom of the sea
        immovable \\ distinguished
            extinguished
    only by the dream itself
coming to be

Though the dream may be
[ ephemeral ]
an essence lingers on
[ invisible | unforgettable ]
